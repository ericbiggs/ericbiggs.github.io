								<h3> verbs, birds and beyond</h3>
								<p>I really am a language nerd. I spend my days thinking about grammar. I am very fascinated with verbs. I spend a lot of time thinking about the principal parts of the verbal system. This includes the verbal system of English, of course. But, I also spend a lot of time thinking about the Ancient Greek and Ancient Hebrew verbal systems. I can easily be found considering the historical development of verbs and how comparative philological evidence may show developmental changes to how a given verbal system has been changed. In case you’re thinking, “Hey, this guy seems pretty narrow minded. He only reflects on the verbal systems of a handful of languages.” Well, the answer to that is… of course not. Verbs are just my favorite, and I am familar with a lot more languages than these. I am also really into prepositions and adverbial clauses, too. I know, if you’re thinking, “Adverbial clauses! What about adjectives!” The answer to that is… yes, I tend to focus on adverbial clauses with only a small portion of my ruminations taking up adjectives (and other parts of speech).</p>

								<p>In addition to my grammar nerdy-ness, my mind enjoys dancing around grammar bits that are coupled to cognitive theories. The image schemas that compose bits of grammar along with the ontological underpinnings they form, are fun to ponder. I enjoy teasing out conceptual integrations (a.k.a. blending) and how the targeting system of language controls deictic aspects of human thought. I am very fascinated with these cognitive systems and I think about them in conjunction with differing aspects of language because, quite frankly, I think they are amazing.</p>

								<p>If you are wondering... yes, I do think about language all the time. However, I busy myself with more than just pondering grammar and how differing cognitive systems operate. For some reason I have found myself taking up the hobby of birding. Yes, I simply walk around and look at birds. Aside from birding, I have a red kite that I love to fly. My kite’s name is Blaze the Brave Little Kite. And indeed Blaze if very brave. He’s been all over the Great Lakes. So now the cat's out of the bag. I spend most of my time flying Blaze on Lake Erie as I live only a few city blocks away from it in downtown Cleveland. But, Blaze has visited every Great Lake. My wife joins in on my kite and birding adventures, while my two teenage daughters are less enthusiastic about these ‘boring’ hobbies. My family is actually what I spend most of my time being occupied with. I am really just a family man that enjoys the company of my wife and daughters. This means my real hobbies involve driving my daughters to ice skating and karate events. My wife, however, takes first place when it comes to my time. We just simply enjoy hanging out with each other.</p>

								<p>So, if you see a brave little kite soaring over the skies of Lake Erie know that some nerdy linguist is likely holding onto it, pondering the historical development of the Ancient Greek participle (yes, participles are verbs) with a charming wife close by. And if you look close enough, you will see each of them warmly sharing a comfortable smile.</p>
